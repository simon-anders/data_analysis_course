# Course: *Best Practices of Data Analysis for Biologists*

These pages contain material for the data analysis course taught by [me](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/Anders/default.shtml) in fall 2018 at [ZMBH](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/)

### [Lecture 1](lecture1.html): Exploring the NHANES data

This lecture explains how to use R/tidverse and ggplot to explore a data set.

[HTML file](lecture1.html)  --  [Rmd file](lecture1.Rmd)

(The HTML file is for reading in your web browser; the Rmd file allows you to open the lecture as notbook in RStudio and rerun all computations.)

I have also recorded the lecture, and uploaded it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CphBsb1UCgs). Not too great quality, though, but maybe useful if you missed the lectrue or a part of it.


### [Lecture 2](lecture2.html): Inference the pedastrian way

In this lecture, we carefully approach the topic of inference, and study the standard error of the mean

### [Lecture 3](lecture2.html): Test statistics, p values and all that

This lecture discussed Fisher test and binomial test to illustrate the idea behind p values

[HTML file](tests.html)  --  [Rmd file](tests.Rmd)

For this lecture, I also have a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg7-wBK9Cxw)
